    Writing results files
      =====================
      2019-01-03 16:07:44 : Done orthologues
      Orthogroups have been written to tab-delimited files:
         /home/skynet/results/GingkoFinal/Orthofinder/OrthoFinder/Results_Jan03/Orthogroups/Orthogroups.tsv
         /home/skynet/results/GingkoFinal/Orthofinder/OrthoFinder/Results_Jan03/Orthogroups/Orthogroups.txt (OrthoMCL format)
         /home/skynet/results/GingkoFinal/Orthofinder/OrthoFinder/Results_Jan03/Orthogroups/Orthogroups_UnassignedGenes.tsv
      Sequences for orthogroups:

      Orthogroup statistics:
         Statistics_PerSpecies.tsv   Statistics_Overall.tsv   Orthogroups_SpeciesOverlaps.tsv

      OrthoFinder assigned 30 genes (0.1% of total) to 9 orthogroups. Fifty percent of all genes were in orthogroups with 1 or more genes (G50 was 1) and were contained in the largest 28279 orthogroups (O50 was 28279). There were 9 orthogroups with all species present and 4 of these consisted entirely of single-copy genes.
